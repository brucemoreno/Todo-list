This is a practice application using Meteor Framework.
To use the application, you'll need the Meteor package e.g. "npm install -g meteor", clone this application, navigate into the folder and them you can run "npm start".
The application uses by default the localhost at the port 3000.
For further information about Meteor you can check the official documentation at: https://docs.meteor.com/.
